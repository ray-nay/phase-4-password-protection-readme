# Password Protection

## Learning Goals

- Explain why it's a bad idea to store passwords in plaintext
- Write code to store and verify hashed, salted passwords
- Use Rails' `has_secure_password` to store and authenticate user login
  credentials securely

## Introduction

It's quite difficult to manage passwords securely. About once a month, there is
another big hack in the news, and all the passwords and credit cards from some
poor site show up on the dark web.

Rails provides us with tools to store passwords securely so that even if our
database is compromised, no one can gain access to users' actual passwords.

## The problem with passwords

Let's imagine a `SessionsController#create` method that does very simple
authentication. It goes like this:

```ruby
def create
  user = User.find_by(username: params[:username])
  if params[:password] == user.password
    session[:user_id] = user.id
    render json: user, status: :created
  else
    render json: { error: "Invalid username or password" }, status: :unauthorized
  end
end
```

We find the user in the database by their username, check to see if the provided
password is equal to the password stored in the database, and, if it is, set
`user_id` in the `session`.

This is tremendously insecure because you then have to store all your users'
passwords in the database, unencrypted.

Never do this.

Even if you don't care about the security of your site, people have a strong
tendency to reuse passwords. That means that the inevitable security breach of
your site will leak passwords which some users also use for Gmail. Your `users`
table probably has an `email` column. This means that, if I'm a hacker, getting
access to your database has given me the Internet equivalent of the house keys
and home address for some (probably surprisingly large) percentage of your
users.

## Hashing Passwords

So how do we store passwords if we can't store passwords?

Instead of storing users' passwords in plain text, we store a hashed version of
them. A _hash_ is a _fixed-length_ output computed by feeding a string to a
_hash function_. Hash functions have the property that they will always produce
the same output given the same input.

A helpful analogy for a hash function is making a smoothie. If I put the exact
same ingredients into the blender, I'll get the exact same smoothie every time.
But there's no way to reverse the operation, and get back the original
ingredients from the smoothie.

Hash functions work in a similar way: given the same input, they'll always
produce the same output; and there's no way to reverse the output and recreate
the original input.

You could even write a hash function yourself. Here's a very simple one:

```ruby
# dumb_hash(input: string) -> number
def dumb_hash(input)
  input.bytes.reduce(:+)
end
```

This `dumb_hash` function just finds the sum of the bytes that comprise the
string. It satisfies the criterion that the same string always produces the same
result. (It doesn't quite meet the "fixed-length output" requirement for hashes,
but for demo purposes, it'll do.)

We could imagine using this function to avoid storing passwords in the database.
Our `User` model and `SessionsController` might look like this:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord

  # takes a plaintext password and stores a hashed version as a password_digest
  def password=(new_password)
    self.password_digest = dumb_hash(new_password)
  end

  # checks if the hashed plaintext password matches the password_digest
  def authenticate(password)
    return nil unless dumb_hash(password) == password_digest
    self
  end

  private

  # the hashing method
  def dumb_hash(input)
    input.bytes.reduce(:+)
  end
end

# app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    user = User.find_by(username: params[:username])
    if user&.authenticate(params[:password])
      session[:user_id] = user.id
      render json: user, status: :created
    else
      render json: { error: "Invalid username or password" }, status: :unauthorized
    end
  end
end
```

> **Note:** [`&.`][safe navigation] is known in Ruby as the "safe navigation
> operator". If `user` is `nil`, it will return `nil`; if not, it will call the
> `.authenticate` method on `user`. It would be similar to writing
> `user && user.authenticate(params[:password])`.

In this world, we have saved the password hashes in a `password_digest` column
in the database. We are not storing the passwords themselves.

With the code above, a user's password is set by calling
`user.password = *new_password*`. Presumably, our `UsersController` would do
this, but we're not worrying about that for the moment.

`dumb_hash` is, as its name suggests, a pretty dumb hash function to use for
this purpose. It's a poor choice because similar strings hash to similar values.
If my password was `Joshua`, you could log in as me by entering the password
`Jnshub`. Since 'n' is one less than 'o' and 'b' is one more than 'a', the
output of `dumb_hash` would be the same. This is known as a _collision_. With
`dumb_hash` as our hashing function, there would be many, similar, variants of
our `Joshua` password (many collisions) that could be used successfully to
access the account, making our authentication process much less secure.

Unfortunately, collisions are inevitable when you're writing a hash function,
since hash functions usually produce either a 32-bit or 64-bit number, and the
space of all possible strings is much larger than either `2**32` or `2**64`.
Fortunately, however, smart people who have thought about this a lot have
written a lot of different hash functions that are well-suited to different
purposes. And nearly all hash functions are designed with the quality that
strings that are similar, but not the same, will hash to significantly different
values.

Ruby internally uses [MurmurHash][murmur], which produces better results for
this:

```rb
'Joshua'.hash
# => 2365460548529352617

'Jnshub'.hash
# => -2645381839118209905
```

But Murmur still isn't ideal, because while it does not produce collisions so
readily, it is still not difficult to produce them if that's what you're trying
to do.

Instead, Rails uses a library called BCrypt. BCrypt is designed with these
properties in mind:

1. BCrypt hashes similar strings to very different values.
2. It is a _cryptographic hash_. That means that, if you have an output in mind,
   finding a string which produces that output is designed to be "very
   difficult." "Very difficult" means "even if Google put all their computers on
   it, they couldn't do it."
3. BCrypt is designed to be slow. It is intentionally computationally expensive.

The last two features make BCrypt a particularly good choice for passwords. (2)
means that, even if an attacker gets your database of hashed passwords, it is
not easy for them to turn a hash back into its original string. (3) means that,
even if an attacker has a dictionary of common passwords to check against, it
will still take them a considerable amount of time to check for your password
against that list.

The [BCrypt gem][bcrypt] is open source, and their documentation has some
excellent examples that demonstrate this functionality. If you're interested in
exploring more, their docs and source code are a great resource.

## Salt

But what if our attackers have done their homework?

Say I'm a hacker. I know I'm going to break into a bunch of sites and get their
password databases. I want to make that worth my while.

Before I do all this breaking and entering, I'm going to find the ten million
most common passwords and hash them with BCrypt. I can do around 1,000 hashes
per second, so that's about three hours. Maybe I'll do the top five hundred
million just to be sure.

It doesn't really matter that this is going to take long time to run â€” I'm only
doing it once. Let's call this mapping of strings to hash outputs a ["rainbow
table"][rainbow_table].

Now, when I get your database, I just look and see if any of the passwords in it
are in my rainbow table. If they are, then I know the password.

Going back to our smoothie analogy, this would be the equivalent of someone
taking all the possible combinations of smoothie ingredients and running them
through the blender to create a giant collection of smoothies. By tasting all
the smoothies, they could figure out which original ingredients were used to
make the smoothie they're trying to identify.

The solution to the rainbow table problem is _salting_ our passwords. A salt is
a random string prepended to the password before hashing it. It's stored in
plain text next to the password, so it's not a secret. But the fact that it's
there makes an attacker's life much more difficult: it's very unlikely that I
constructed my rainbow table with your particular salt in mind, so I'm back to
running the hash algorithm over and over as I guess passwords. And, remember,
BCrypt is designed to be expensive to run.

Let's update our `User` model to use BCrypt:

```ruby
# Gemfile:
gem 'bcrypt'

# app/models/user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base

  # generate a salted + hashed password and save it to password_digest
  def password=(new_password)
    salt = BCrypt::Engine::generate_salt
    # => $2a$12$UW5etUc/o1YL4sSdeTBPku
    self.password_digest = BCrypt::Engine::hash_secret(new_password, salt)
    # => $2a$12$UW5etUc/o1YL4sSdeTBPkueUWwNIPNdQNAwzuSGkS3L5coBKMMZHm"
  end

  # check the plaintext password against the salted + hashed password
  def authenticate(password)
    # Salts generated by generate_salt are always 29 chars long.
    salt = password_digest[0..28]
    # compare the saved password_digest against the plaintext password by running the plaintext password through the same hashing function
    return nil unless BCrypt::Engine::hash_secret(password, salt) == self.password_digest
    self
  end
end
```

Our `users.password_digest` column really stores two values: the salt and the
actual return value of BCrypt. We just concatenate them together in the column
and use our knowledge of the length of salts â€” `generate_salt` always produces
29-character strings â€” to separate them.

After we've loaded the User, we find the salt which we previously stored in
their `password_digest` column. We run the password we were given in `params`
through BCrypt along with the salt we read from the database. If the results
match, you're in. If they don't, no dice.

## Rails Makes It Easier

You don't have to deal with all this yourself. Rails provides a method called
`has_secure_password` that you can use on your Active Record models to handle
all of this. It looks like this:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_secure_password
end
```

To use the `has_secure_password` macro, you'll need to add `gem 'bcrypt'` to
your Gemfile if it isn't there already.

When using [`has_secure_password`][has_secure_password], Rails will use the
`bcrypt` gem to hash and salt all passwords on the `User` model.

The [`has_secure_password`][has_secure_password] method also provides two new
instance methods on your `User` model: `password` and `password_confirmation`.
These methods don't correspond to database columns! Instead, to make these
methods work, your `users` table **must** have a `password_digest` column:

```rb
create_table :users do |t|
  t.string :username
  t.string :password_digest

  t.timestamps
end
```

These two instance methods enable you to easily include password and password
confirmation fields in a signup (or password reset) form. `has_secure_password`
handles these fields by adding a `before_save` hook to your model that compares
`password` and `password_confirmation`. If they match (or if
`password_confirmation` is `nil`), the user is saved and the hashed version of
the password is stored in the `password_digest` column of the database, pretty
much exactly like our example code before did.

Under the hood, `has_secure_password` calls upon an Active Record helper method,
[`validates_confirmation_of`][validates_confirmation_of]. As such, as with other
Active Record validator methods, when the fields don't match and the validation
fails, an `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exception will be raised. You can handle
this exception by using `rescue` or `rescue_from`.

All together, the code implementing the signup functionality of our very secure
app might look like this:

```jsx
function SignUp({ onLogin }) {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState("");
  const [password, setPassword] = useState("");
  const [passwordConfirmation, setPasswordConfirmation] = useState("");

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    fetch("/signup", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        username,
        password,
        password_confirmation: passwordConfirmation,
      }),
    })
      .then((r) => r.json())
      .then(onLogin);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label htmlFor="username">Username:</label>
      <input
        type="text"
        id="username"
        value={username}
        onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}
      />
      <label htmlFor="password">Password:</label>
      <input
        type="password"
        id="password"
        value={password}
        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
      />
      <label htmlFor="password_confirmation">Confirm Password:</label>
      <input
        type="password"
        id="password_confirmation"
        value={passwordConfirmation}
        onChange={(e) => setPasswordConfirmation(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    user = User.create(user_params)
    if user.valid?
      render json: user, status: :created
    else
      render json: { errors: user.errors.full_messages }, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private

  def user_params
    params.permit(:username, :password, :password_confirmation)
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    user = User.find_by(username: params[:username])
    if user&.authenticate(params[:password])
      session[:user_id] = user.id
      render json: user, status: :created
    else
      render json: { error: "Invalid username or password" }, status: :unauthorized
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_secure_password
end
```

## Conclusion

When dealing with users' passwords, it's important for security that we never
store passwords in our database directly in plain text. Instead, we can use a
trusted library like BCrypt to help keep our users' passwords safe.

## Check For Understanding

Before you move on, make sure you can answer the following questions:

1. What setup steps do you need to complete to use BCrypt in your Rails app?
2. What two things does BCrypt do to secure passwords?
